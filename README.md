# 📝 List App – Vanilla JS & React (Next.js)

This repository contains two implementations of the same application: a list manager built in both Vanilla JavaScript and React with Next.js.

## 🚀 App Functionality

The application allows users to:

✅ Add text items to a list via a modal

✅ Select or deselect individual items

✅ Delete selected items

✅ Delete an item with double-click

✅ Undo the last action (add/delete)

The goal is to replicate the same features and UI in two different front-end environments, demonstrating:

- Component-based design in React
- State management and user interaction in Vanilla JS
- Reusable logic, transitions, and modular styling

### Run projects

Each project has its own README.md with instructions on how to run the app.
